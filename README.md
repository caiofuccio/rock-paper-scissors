## Second Part

- Use of classes and containers to keep the html organized, readable and easy to handle;
- CSS and JavaScript transition (fade-in / fade-out) to create a dynamic page;
- DOM manipulation with CSS;
- Event listening with JavaScript;

## Future Improvements

- Adding a visual representation when the player and the computer choose their hands, maybe change the cards backround color;
- Also, make the project scalable for different screen sizes. It is now only optimized for computer screens, not for mobile devices;
- Adding sounds.
